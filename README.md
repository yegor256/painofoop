**THE COURSE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

There are slides for my series of lectures for a Innopolis University (Kazan, Russia).

All recorded videos (so far) are in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08ytf8POIIAkkR4ZsRq8DFiV).

All compiled slide decks in PDF are [here](https://yegor256.github.io/painofoop/).

To compile everything just run:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```
$ make clean
```
