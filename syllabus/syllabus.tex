\begin{abstract}
The course is a critical review of the current situation in object-oriented programming,
especially in Java, C++, Ruby, and JavaScript worlds. At the course, certain programming
idioms, which sometimes are called ``best practices,'' are criticized for their
negative impact on code quality, including static methods, NULL references, getters
and setters, ORM and DTO, annotations, traits and mixins, inheritance, and many others.
Much ``cleaner'' object-oriented programming practices will be proposed instead. Most
lectures are organized as reviews of existing code snippets from well-known
open source libraries.
\end{abstract}

% \section*{Introduction}

\textbf{What is the goal?}\\
The primary objective of the course is to help students understand the
difference between ``object thinking,'' originally motivated the
appearance of OOP, and the modern practices that often
severly impact the quality of code in a negative way.

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}\\
Yegor is developing software for more than 30 years, being a hands-on programmer
(see his GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256})
and a manager of other programmers. At the moment Yegor is a director
of an R\&D laboratory in Huawei. His primary research focus is
software quality problems. Some of the lectures he has recently presented
at some software conferences could be found at
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{his YouTube channel}.
Yegor also published a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{few books}
and wrote a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{blog} about software engineering
and object-oriented programming.
Yegor previously tought a few courses in
Innopolis University (Kazan, Russia)
and HSE University (Moscow, Russia),
for example,
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ssd16}{Software Systems Design (2021)},
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/eqsp}{Ensuring Quality in Software Projects (2022)},
and
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ppa}{Practical Program Analysis (2023)}
(all videos are available).

\textbf{Why this course?}\\
Maintainability of object-oriented software that most of us programmers write these days is
way below our expectations. Two main reasons for that is our misunderstanding
of what objects are. This course may help clear things up.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}\\
Each lecture is an overview of existing source code from well-known open source
libraries and frameworks, mostly from Apache. In an interactive discussion mode
we will go through their code and find out whether their programming practices
are in line with ``object thinking'' .

\section*{Course Structure}

Prerequisites to the course (it is expected that a student knows this):

\begin{itemize}
\item How to write code
\item How to design software
\end{itemize}

After the course a student \emph{hopefully} will understand:

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the difference between objects and data?
\item Why static methods are bad?
\item What is immutability and why it's good?
\item How to design a constructor?
\item How to handle exceptions right?
\item What data hiding is for?
\item What's wrong with Printers, Writers, Scanners, and Readers?
\item Why NULL references are a billion-dollar mistake?
\item What's wrong with mixins and traits?
\item How to avoid getters and setters?
\item How declarative programming is better than imperative?
\item Why composition is better than inheritance?
\item Where to store the data if DTO is a bad practice?
\item How to avoid ORM design pattern?
\item Why long names of variables is bad design?
\item Why type casting and type checking are against OOP?
\item What is cohesion and why it matters?
\item How to apply SOLID and SRP principles?
\item What Inversion of Control is for and why DI Containers are evil?
\item Why MVC is a bad design idea?
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Lectures}

The following topics are discussed:

\newlist{lectures}{enumerate}{10}
\setlist[lectures]{label*=\arabic*.}
\begin{lectures}
\item Algorithms
\item Static Methods
\item Getters
\item Setters
\item ``-er'' suffix
\item NULL references
\item Type casting and reflection
\item Inheritance
\end{lectures}

\newpage
\section*{Grading}

Students form groups of 1--3 people. Each group presents
its own public GitHub repository with a software module inside.
It may be any piece of object-oriented software as long as it has more than 5,000 lines
of code written personally by the students.
Higher grades will be given
for better object-oriented practices used in the code. Lower grades will be
given for the presence of static methods, NULLs, getters, setters, mutability,
ORM, DTO, factories, type casting, and other anti-OOP practices (as suggested during the course).

At the laboratory classes each group will have to present
their projects three times with at least 14 calendar days interval between presentations.
The presence of all three presentations guarantees ``B''.
The absence of two or more guarantees not ``A''.

The attendance is tracked at the lectures. If 75\% of all lectures were attended,
it guarantees ``C'' (otherwise ignored).
